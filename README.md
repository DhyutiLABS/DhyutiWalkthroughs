## 🧠 What’s Inside

Each walkthrough contains:
- 🧩 **Concept Primer** — concise background and intuition behind the chosen model or method  
- 💻 **Interactive Notebook (Colab-ready)** — live coding with comments and explanations  
- 🎨 **Visual Insights** — auto-plotted results, error surfaces, and physics residuals  
- 🔄 **Generalised Templates** — easy to adapt for your own problem or dataset  
- 🧬 **Cross-Domain Mapping** — linking 1D analogs to large-scale real-world applications
